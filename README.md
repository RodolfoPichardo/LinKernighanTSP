# LinKernighanTSP
A java implementation of the -famous- Lin-Kernighan heuristics algorithm implemented for graphic (symmetric) TSP.

## Features
It implements exactly the same features described by Shen Lin and Brian Kernighan in their original paper "An Effective Heuristic Algorithm for the Traveling-Salesman Problem"

In addition, this implementation reads *.tsp* files to form a representation of the TSP problem; however, the format of the *.tsp* file is not yet TSPLIB compliant, but it would be a nice and easy issue to fix.

## How to contribute
We want to keep contributions as simple as posible, so the rules are simple: you contribute changes, I review them, if I agree with the changes I will pull it down.

That being said, there are a few recommendations for the quality of code to contribute:
* Efficiency: make the code as efficient as possible, efficiency is one of the key aspects of this kind of algorithms.
* Readability: document all the new functions by adding comments, and if there are tricky pieces of code, comment them as well.
* Reliability: ensure the code works!

Finally, review the TODO list in this page.

## How to run
Currently, the code is ran by compiling all the files and running the Main class.
